# JavaNote
Notepad clone, written a long time ago. Not really proud of it now.

I wrote it using DrJava on Windows, and the paths for images etc. are not fine on Linux. It's an old project, 
so I didn't bother fixing it now. 
There are a few bugs, and today I'm not satisfied with how I wrote the classes, I now see I could have saved a lot of time and 
typing by thinking more in advance. Doesn't matter now, this is still my first bigger GUI app.
